<h1>Progress till 4 April, 2014 (DRAFT)</h1>

<h2>Progress-In-Brief (Questions Asked Thus Far)</h2>

<p>1.What are the differentially expressed genes between wild type and sxy mutants at time = 30?</p>

<pre><code>Question addressed using 2 different analysis packages (EdgeR and DESeq).
For EdgeR:
The statistical cut-off used was q-value &lt; 0.05, where q-value is the Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value.
-131 genes were differentially expressed.
-77 of them were down-regulated.
-54 of them were up-regulated.

-26 of 27 known crp-S related genes were down-regulated.
-1 of 27 (ssb) did not show significant expression difference.

For DESeq:
Similar to the EdgeR pipeline, the statistical cut-off used was q-value &lt; 0.05.
-64 genes were differentially expressed.
-Unknown genes were down or up-regulated. [To be confirmed]

-25 of 27 known crp-S related genes were differentially expressed.
They are expected to be down-regulated. [To be confirmed]
-2 out of 27 did not show significant expression difference. [To be confirmed]
</code></pre>

<p>2.What are the differentially expressed genes between wild type and sxy mutants at time = 0?</p>

<pre><code>Question addressed using EdgeR only.
The statistical cut-off used was q-value &lt; 0.05, where q-value is the Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value.
-53 genes were differentially expressed.
-Unknown genes were down or up-regulated. [To be confirmed]

-1 of 27 known crp-S related genes were differentially expressed.
-The gene is sxy (a.k.a. tfoX), and since sxy is absent in the sxy mutant, it is no surprise that it is differentially expressed.
-26 out of 27 did not show significant expression difference.
</code></pre>

<h2>Questions to complete the above analysis</h2>

<p>For time = 30,</p>

<ol>
<li>Why are the number of genes identified by EdgeR and DESeq so different? (In-Progress)</li>
<li>Are the genes identified by DESeq also found in EdgeR?</li>
<li>[DESeq] How many genes are up/down-regulated?</li>
<li>[DESeq] How many of the crp-S genes are up/down-regulated?</li>
<li>[DESeq] What are the non-differentially expressed genes?</li>
<li>[DESeq and EdgeR] How many of the differentially expressed genes are crp-N genes (at least, 1st gene of the operon)?</li>
</ol>

<p>For time = 0,</p>

<ol>
<li>[EdgeR] How many genes are up/down-regulated?</li>
<li>[EdgeR] How many genes are crp-N genes (at least, 1st gene of the operon)?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Significance of Analysis</h2>

<p>Question 1 (WT vs sxy at t = 30) shows which genes require sxy for expression when grown in starvation media (M4 media).</p>

<p>Question 2 (WT vs sxy at t = 0) however shows which genes may (?) require baseline sxy expression for normal expression. Is the expression differential really that different/significant? This comparison is pretty interesting in the sense that the current assumption is that sxy expression is significant during starvation (for competence), but what about during &ldquo;normal&rdquo; circumstances?</p>

<h2>New Questions</h2>

<ol>
<li>What is the distribution of q-values for WT vs sxy at time = 0, 30?</li>
<li>[Redundant?] What are the differentially expressed genes for wild type between time = 0 and 30?</li>
<li>[Redundant?] Similarly, for genes in the sxy mutant between time = 0 and 30?</li>
<li>[Redundant?] Do the genes Q2, when subtracted with those in Q3, give the same results as the comparison between WT and sxy at time = 30?</li>
<li>??</li>
</ol>
